Use the dpad or the arrows keys / PageUp/Down to switch to neighboring room(s).

Hovering on the dpad arrows will show the neighboring room in a pop-up.

# Smart Room Shift

Pressing Alt will instead of just switching to the room also create a gap so it switches to a new/empty room at that side.

Parameters:
- QuickShiftKeepGap: whether gaps (where there are no rooms on the map) should be preserved when moving rooms.
