# Room Templates

When selecting a not-yet-existing room on the map a blank drawing or a room by the selected template is shown.

The room will be created as soon you draw into the room, create new layers, or press the "Create this Room" button.

- Left Mouse: Select this template as the template when navigating to an empty space with quickroom dpad / arrow keys.
- Right Mouse: Unselect this template, so no template is selected and blank room acts as template.
- Middle Mouse: Turn the current room in the drawing area into this template. Changes to the room afterwards won't affect the template.
